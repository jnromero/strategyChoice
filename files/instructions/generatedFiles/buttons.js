'],[11.719,'  Welcome '],[12.960,'  You  are  about  to  participate  in  an  experiment  in  the  economics  of  decision making  '],[18.503,'  If  you  listen  carefully '],[20.103,'   you  could  earn  a  large  amount  of  money '],[22.060,'   that  will  be  paid  to  you  in  cash '],[24.161,'   in  private '],[25.033,'   at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[27.715,'  It  is  important  that  you  remain  silent '],[29.959,'   and  do  not  look  at  other  people\'s  work  '],[32.997,'  If  you  have  any  questions '],[34.561,'   or  need  any  assistance  of  any  kind '],[36.738,'   please  raise  your  hand  and  an  experimenter  will  help  you  out  '],[40.869,'  During  the  experiment '],[42.377,'   do  not  talk '],[43.415,'   laugh  or  exclaim  out  loud  and  be  sure  to  keep  your  eyes  on  your  screen  only  '],[48.655,'  In  addition '],[49.703,'   please  turn  off  your  cell  phones '],[51.623,'   etc  '],[53.424,'  and  put  them  away  during  the  experiment  '],[56.624,'  Anybody  that  violates  these  rules  will  be  asked  to  leave  and  will  not  be  paid  '],[61.747,'  We  expect '],[62.518,'   and  appreciate  your  cooperation  '],[66.022,'  Agenda '],[67.268,'  one  '],[69.429,'  Instructions  '],[71.537,'  two  '],[73.819,'  Quiz '],[75.094,'   to  make  sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions   '],[79.641,'  The  quiz  will  consist  of  twelve  questions  '],[83.152,'  The  experiment  will  not  begin  until  everyone  has  correctly  answered  all  questions  '],[88.774,'  three  '],[90.949,'  Experiment  '],[92.931,'  four  '],[95.201,'  Three  additional  tasks  '],[97.874,'  five  '],[100.156,'  Survey  '],[101.935,'  After  you  have  completed  the  experiment '],[104.177,'   you  will  be  asked  to  answer  several  survey  questions  using  the  computer  '],[109.107,'  six  '],[111.431,'  Payment  '],[113.166,'  After  everyone  has  finished  the  survey '],[115.619,'   you  will  be  paid  in  cash  '],[118.677,'  Experiment  Overview '],[120.685,'  In  the  experiment  today  you  will  be  matched  into  pairs '],[123.901,'   and  will  be  asked  to  make  choices  '],[126.849,'  The  choices  made  by  you  may  affect  both  your  payoff '],[129.660,'   as  well  as  the  payoff  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  '],[133.844,'  Similarly '],[134.856,'   the  choices  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  may  affect  their  payoff  and  your  payoff  '],[140.941,'  Experiment  Details '],[143.035,'  In  the  experiment  today '],[144.637,'   you  will  be  working  with  a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs  '],[149.032,'  You  will  be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[153.494,'  Exchange  rate   '],[155.156,'  twenty  Francs  equals  one  dollar  '],[158.220,'  This  experiment  consists  of  five  matches '],[160.981,'   each  of  which  may  have  a  different  number  of  periods '],[163.673,'   and  may  have  different  payoffs  '],[166.443,'  At  the  beginning  of  each  match '],[168.313,'   you  will  be  matched  with  one  other  subject  that  you  have  not  been  matched  with  before  '],[173.346,'  The  random  pairing  will  ensure  that  if  you  have  been  paired  with  another  participant  before '],[178.190,'   then  you  will  never  be  paired  with  this  same  participant  in  another  match  again  '],[183.382,'  You  will  remain  anonymous  throughout  the  experiment  '],[187.057,'  You  will  not  know  the  identity  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[190.343,'   and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  will  not  know  your  identity  '],[194.739,'  The  choices  made  by  you '],[196.350,'   and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[198.336,'   have  no  effect  on  the  payoffs  of  other  pairs  of  subjects '],[201.629,'   and  vice  versa  '],[203.752,'  You  will  remain  matched  with  this  same  subject  until  the  end  of  the  match  '],[208.310,'  After  you  and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  have  finished  the  match '],[212.143,'   please  wait  quietly  for  all  pairs  to  finish  their  match  '],[216.372,'  Once  all  pairs  have  finished  their  match '],[218.644,'   you  will  be  randomly  re matched  with  another  subject  that  you  have  not  been  matched  with  yet '],[223.059,'   and  the  next  match  will  begin  '],[226.297,'  Experimental  Interface '],[228.499,'  Next '],[229.288,'   we  will  go  over  the  experimental  interface  '],[232.794,'  The  experimental  interface  consists  of  five  components '],[236.684,'  one  '],[238.846,'  The  payoff  table  is  displayed  at  the  top  left  of  the  screen  '],[243.418,'  The  payoff  table  has  your  choices '],[246.147,'   the  rows '],[247.071,'   U '],[247.754,'   and  D  '],[248.983,'  and  the  choices  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[252.321,'   the  columns '],[253.366,'   L '],[253.994,'   and  R   '],[256.224,'  For  any  combination  of  choices  for  you  and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[260.384,'   there  is  a  payoff  '],[262.572,'  Your  payoff  is  on  the  left '],[264.202,'   and  the  payoff  for  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  on  the  right  '],[268.586,'  For  example '],[269.700,'   if  you  choose  D '],[270.898,'   and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  chooses  L '],[273.759,'   then  your  payoff  is  six '],[275.526,'   and  the  payoff  for  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  three  '],[279.742,'  The  payoff  table  in  the  experiment  today  will  be  different  than  the  one  displayed  here  '],[285.521,'  In  addition '],[286.531,'   the  payoffs  will  remain  the  same  for  all  periods  in  a  single  match '],[290.146,'   but  may  change  in  different  matches  '],[293.217,'  two  '],[295.296,'  The  summary  of  the  current  period  is  shown  in  the  top  right  '],[299.675,'  three  '],[301.853,'  The  summary  of  all  periods  is  shown  below  that  '],[305.675,'  four  '],[307.954,'  The  history  of  play  is  displayed  in  the  bottom  half  of  the  screen  '],[312.654,'  five  '],[314.962,'  Finally '],[315.824,'   the  current  status  is  displayed  across  the  middle  of  the  screen  '],[320.488,'  The  current  status  tells  you  what  to  do  at  any  point  during  the  experiment  '],[325.991,'  Specific  Instructions  for  Each  Period '],[328.991,'  At  any  point  during  a  period '],[330.767,'   you  will  see  one  of  three  status  messages '],[333.985,'  Status   number one '],[336.011,'  Please  select  My  Choice '],[338.062,'   U '],[338.716,' D  '],[339.856,'  and  your  guess  for  Other\'s  Choice '],[342.190,'   L '],[342.790,' R   '],[344.886,'  When  you  see  this  status  message '],[346.839,'   you  need  to  do  two  things  '],[349.606,'  one  '],[351.769,'  Select  a  row  for  your  choice '],[354.041,'   in  this  example  either  U '],[355.727,'   or  D   '],[357.998,'  Once  you  have  selected  a  row '],[359.797,'   it  will  be  outlined '],[361.140,'   and  the  label  My  Choice  will  be  added  '],[364.227,'  My  choice  will  also  be  updated  on  the  period  summary  '],[368.328,'  two  '],[370.406,'  Select  the  column  that  you  think  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  will  select '],[374.795,'   in  this  example  either  L '],[376.451,'   or  R   '],[378.620,'  Once  you  have  selected  a  column '],[380.535,'   it  will  be  outlined '],[381.877,'   and  the  label  My  Guess  will  be  added  '],[384.783,'  My  guess  will  also  be  updated  on  the  period  summary  '],[388.766,'  If  you  correctly  guess  the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  in  a  given  period '],[393.301,'   then  you  will  earn  a  raffle  ticket  '],[396.169,'  At  the  end  of  the  experiment '],[398.000,'   one  raffle  ticket  will  be  randomly  selected '],[400.730,'   and  the  winner  will  receive  a  bonus  of  five  dollars  '],[404.641,'  Therefore '],[405.572,'   the  more  correct  guesses  you  make '],[407.798,'   the  more  likely  you  are  to  win  the  five  dollars  bonus  '],[411.912,'  Status   number two '],[413.820,'  Please  wait  for  the  other  subject  to  finish  making  their  choices  '],[418.119,'  When  you  see  this  status  message '],[420.094,'   please  wait  patiently  for  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  to  finish  making  their  choices  '],[426.134,'  If  the  other  subject  makes  their  choices  before  you  in  a  specific  period '],[430.297,'   you  might  not  see  this  status  '],[433.228,'  Status   number three '],[435.281,'  Click  on  the  payoffs  for  this  period '],[437.867,'   in  green  '],[439.228,'  in  the  game  table  to  move  to  next  period  '],[442.808,'  When  you  see  this  status  message '],[444.761,'   all  choices  for  the  period  have  been  made '],[447.286,'   and  you  can  view  the  final  results  '],[450.449,'  The  column  selected  by  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  highlighted  and  labeled  Other\'s  Choice  '],[456.608,'  If  your  guess  about  their  choice  was  correct '],[459.008,'   then  the  column  will  be  highlighted  in  yellow  '],[462.340,'  The  entry  of  the  payoff  table  that  is  at  the  intersection  of  the  row  that  you  selected '],[467.088,'   and  the  column  that  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  selected '],[470.233,'   is  highlighted  in  green  '],[472.661,'  This  entry  displays  the  payoffs  for  the  current  period  '],[476.852,'  Your  payoff  for  the  period  is  displayed  on  the  left '],[479.889,'   and  the  payoff  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  displayed  on  the  right  '],[484.834,'  At  this  point '],[485.750,'   the  period  summary  has  been  updated  to  include  the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[490.741,'   and  the  current  payoffs  for  this  period  '],[493.988,'  These  choices  have  also  been  added  to  the  history  of  play  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  '],[499.603,'  Finally '],[500.463,'   the  overall  summary  has  been  updated  to  include  the  total  payoffs  including  this  period '],[505.380,'   as  well  as  the  number  of  correct  guesses  you  have  made  about  the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  '],[511.929,'  To  move  on  to  the  next  period '],[513.709,'   you  need  to  click  the  payoffs  for  this  period  in  the  game  table '],[517.104,'   which  have  been  highlighted  in  green  '],[523.378,'  Number  of  Periods  Per  Match '],[525.699,'  The  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined  randomly  using  the  following  procedure  '],[531.691,'  At  the  end  of  each  period '],[533.318,'   a  number  will  be  chosen  randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   '],[536.718,' one '],[537.474,' two '],[538.197,' three '],[538.965,'   up  to '],[539.750,'   ninety eight '],[540.758,'   ninety nine '],[541.892,'   one hundred '],[542.795,'   where  each  number  is  equally  likely  '],[545.952,'  If  the  number  is  one '],[547.454,'   then  the  match  will  end  '],[549.880,'  If  the  number  is  not  one '],[551.604,'   then  the  match  will  continue  '],[554.400,'  The  number  will  always  be  placed  back  into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn  '],[559.015,'  Thus '],[559.699,'   in  any  period  there  is  a  one  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  end '],[563.456,'   and  a  ninety nine  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  have  another  period  '],[568.189,'  Therefore '],[569.119,'   the  expected  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  one hundred  '],[573.618,'  This  procedure  has  been  performed  on  the  computer  before  the  experiment  '],[578.555,'  Therefore '],[579.483,'   you  will  not  see  the  number  selected  from   '],[581.629,' one '],[582.372,' two '],[583.093,' three '],[583.863,'   up  to '],[584.648,'   ninety eight '],[585.656,'   ninety nine '],[586.801,'   one hundred '],[588.676,'  To  ensure  that  the  length  of  the  match  is  not  dependent  on  your  play '],[592.248,'   the  number  of  periods  for  each  match  has  been  written  on  the  board  before  the  experiment '],[596.709,'   and  will  be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[600.828,'  Payoffs '],[602.074,'  Your  payment  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  will  contain  the  following '],[606.136,'  one  '],[608.297,'  The  five  dollars  show  up  fee  '],[611.241,'  two  '],[613.561,'  Payment  for  a  randomly  selected  block  of  thirty  periods  '],[617.916,'  three  '],[620.092,'  A  bonus  payment  of  five  dollars  if  one  of  your  raffle  tickets  is  randomly  selected  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[627.368,'  four  '],[629.662,'  Payment  for  the  additional  tasks  after  the  main  experiment  '],[634.063,'  At  the  end  of  the  experiment '],[635.857,'   your  earnings  in  Francs  will  be  converted  into  US  Dollars  and  you  will  be  paid  in  cash '],[640.808,'   in  private  '],[642.646,'  The  randomly  selected  block  of  thirty  periods  will  be  determined  as  follows '],[647.389,'  One  period  from  the  experiment  will  be  selected  at  random  '],[652.097,'  The  block  of  thirty  periods  will  contain  this  period '],[655.027,'   and  the  following  twenty nine  periods  '],[658.324,'  The  block  of  thirty  periods  may  span  multiple  matches  '],[662.676,'  If  the  randomly  selected  period  is  one  of  the  last  twenty nine  periods  of  the  experiment '],[667.711,'   then  the  block  will  loop  around  to  the  first  period  of  the  experiment '],[671.483,'   and  continue  from  there  '],[674.010,'  Therefore '],[674.939,'   the  chance  of  getting  paid  in  every  period  of  the  experiment  is  the  same  '],[680.006,'  Each  choice  you  make  is  therefore  important  because  it  has  a  chance  of  determining  the  amount  of  money  you  earn  '],[686.784,'  The  randomly  selected  period  has  been  drawn  before  the  experiment  '],[691.533,'  To  ensure  that  the  randomly  selected  period  is  not  dependent  on  your  choices '],[696.112,'   it  has  been  written  on  the  board '],[697.927,'   and  will  be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[701.466,'  Here  are  some  examples '],[703.588,'  First '],[704.356,'   a  regular  example  '],[706.784,'  If  the  random  period  is  period  fourteen  of  match  number  four '],[710.666,'   then  the  block  will  contain  periods  fourteen  through  forty three  of  match  number  four  '],[716.379,'  Next '],[717.172,'   and  example  that  spans  multiple  matches  '],[720.904,'  If  match  number  two  has  one hundred  periods '],[723.563,'   and  the  randomly  selected  period  is  period  ninety one  of  match  number  two '],[728.083,'   then  the  block  will  contain  periods  ninety one  through  one hundred  of  match  number  two '],[732.493,'   and  periods  one  through  twenty  of  match  number  three  '],[736.571,'  Finally '],[737.432,'   an  example  that  loops  around  to  the  beginning  '],[741.009,'  If  match  number  five  has  eighty five  periods '],[743.898,'   and  the  randomly  selected  period  is  period  eighty one  of  match  number  five '],[748.536,'   then  the  block  will  contain  periods  eighty one  through  eighty five  of  match  number  five '],[753.281,'   and  periods  one  through  twenty five  of  match  number  one  '],[757.617,'']];
